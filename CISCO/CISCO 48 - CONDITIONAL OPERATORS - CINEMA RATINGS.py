### PROJECT: CISCO DevNet - CONDITIONAL OPERATORS - CINEMA RATINGS
### VER: 1.0
### DATE: 06-XX-2021


### OBJECTIVE ###
# According to the British Board of Film Classification, movies shown at the cinema in the UK should have one of the following age certificate ratings:
# Using your knowledge of selection, comparative operators and Boolean operators, write a Python program that will do the following:
# 1. Ask the user to enter their age.
# 2. Output a list of film age certificates which the user can watch
# (i.e. U, PG, 12A, 12, 15 or 18).
# 3. When you have finished: Test your program several times to make sure that it works. Then test someone elseâ€™s program.
